## About Dataset
Records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report.

2. What percentage of flights in experienced a departure delay in 2015? Among those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?
3. How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year? What about for flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically?
4. How many flights were cancelled in 2015? What % of cancellations were due to weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?
